Purpose 

Stock't is designed to streamline inventory management for flower shops, 
addressing key user needs such as low stock alerts, easy inventory tracking, and 
efficient communication regarding inventory levels. Developed specifically for flower shop owners 
and managers, the app simplifies inventory management and enhances user experience by allowing users 
to easily monitor stock levels and receive timely alerts, ensuring they are always informed about their inventory. 

Screens and features 

The app features a home screen that displays current inventory levels, an inventory tracking 
system for adding and updating items, and SMS notifications for low stock alerts. Throughout
the design process, user feedback played a crucial role, resulting in an intuitive and efficient 
navigation experience. 

Coding Approach & Functionality 

I utilized agile methodology during the development process, allowing for flexibility 
and rapid iteration based on feedback. Starting with a minimal viable product (MVP), I 
focused on core functionalities before expanding features, ensuring that the app aligned 
with user needs. To ensure functionality, I conducted user testing sessions and implemented 
tests for core features. This rigorous testing process was vital in identifying bugs and 
usability issues early, ensuring the app met user expectations. 


One significant challenge I faced was during the coding of the deletion feature. Initially, 
items were set to be deleted by name, which caused the entire database table to malfunction. 
I resolved this issue by reworking the code to delete items by their unique ID, which stabilized 
the database and improved the app's reliability. 


Overall, this project showcased my expertise in user-centered design, emphasizing the importance 
of feedback and iterative refinement. This approach not only enhanced the app's usability but also 
highlighted the value of prioritizing user needs throughout the development process.
